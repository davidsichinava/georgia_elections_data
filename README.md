## 2024 Parliamentary Elections

This [folder](/2024_parliamentary) contains election data digitized by 87 volunteers. Since the CEC doesn't immediately digitize full protocol data, we did it manually. Files will be updated periodically if I find data entry errors. If you do too, drop me a line at david[at]sichinava[dot]ge. Data cleaning code as well as raw export from the Kobo server are included: The code needs to be tweaked to reflect offline data structure, but you should be able to replicate the full process and track what had been changed as a result of quality control.

Here are data collected by other people:

I also exported CEC data (both electronic and hand count) and documented discrepancies [here](2024_parliamentary/cec_data/electronic_machines_vs_hand_count.csv)
