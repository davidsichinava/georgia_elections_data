# Georgia (country) elections data

This repository stores raw data and analysis of Georgian (country) elections.

## 2024 Parliamentary Elections


This [folder](/2024_parliamentary) contains election data digitized by 87 volunteers. Since the CEC doesn't immediately digitize full protocol data, we did it manually. Data will be updated periodically if I find data entry errors. If you do too, drop me a line at david[at]sichinava[dot]ge.

Here are data collected by other people:
